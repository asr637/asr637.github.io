            <h2>Project Concept</h2>
            <p>An audio exploration of dream paralysis - the fear that prevents us from pursuing ambitions until it's almost too late. Through the story of an aspiring pianist's nightmare and awakening, we immerse listeners in her emotional journey using carefully crafted soundscapes.</p>

                    <h3>Creative Process</h3>
                    <p>We developed the narrative through mood boards, wireframed the website in Canva, and collected sounds from freesound.org. After recording in the Equipment Centre, we mixed the final audio in Audacity to create an immersive experience that prioritizes emotional depth over technical complexity.</p>

                    <h3>Reflection</h3>
                    <p>While we initially envisioned more interactive web features, we ultimately focused on audio storytelling purity. This decision strengthened our core message about overcoming fear to pursue dreams.</p>
